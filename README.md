# HLang, A Toy Compiler

This project is yet another toy compiler project.

For the front end I am writing a Lexer, Parser, and intemediate code generator in C.

The backend will also be written in C. My code generator will generate x86_64 assembly.
For now I will be using the GNU Assembler to generate machine code. Who knows, I may get around to writing an assembler myself.
